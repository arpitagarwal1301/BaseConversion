# BaseConversion
Conversion between Bases  Write a program to convert between bases of any order from 2 to 16. The input should be in base 10. Output should be in the base of the user's choice.  Example: Enter number in base 10: 10 Enter base: 2 Output: 1010 Please note that the input must be a non-negative number from 0 to 256 inclusive. Also, as can be seen, you don't need to include leading 0s in the output. Also, for the higher bases (above base 10), A would stand for 10, B for 11 and so on.
